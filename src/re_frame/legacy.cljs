; this middleware is included for backward compatibility, it is not used anymore
(defn pure
  "Acts as an adaptor, allowing handlers to be writen as pure functions.
  The re-frame router passes the `app-db` atom as the first parameter to any handler.
  This middleware adapts that atom to be the value within the atom.
  If you strip away the error/efficiency checks, this middleware is doing:
     (reset! app-db (handler @app-db event-vec))
  You don't have to use this middleware directly. It is automatically applied to
  your handler's middleware when you use \"register-handler\".
  In fact, the only way to by-pass automatic use of \"pure\" in your middleware
  is to use the low level registration function \"re-frame.handlers/register-handler-base\""
